## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Areas
1. **Deck System Complexity** - Card interactions and effects
   - *Mitigation*: Start with simple cards, iterate complexity gradually

2. **Procedural Event System** - Balancing randomness and narrative coherence
   - *Mitigation*: Extensive testing with weighted pools, narrative validation

3. **Mobile Performance** - Phaser 3 on mobile browsers
   - *Mitigation*: Early mobile testing, performance budgets, optimization

### Medium Risk Areas
1. **QTE System Integration** - Real-time elements in turn-based game
   - *Mitigation*: Clear separation of systems, extensive playtesting

2. **Narrative Branching Complexity** - State management across timelines
   - *Mitigation*: Simple state machine first, expand gradually

### Low Risk Areas
1. **UI System** - Well-understood patterns with Phaser 3
2. **Basic Scene Management** - Standard Phaser 3 functionality
3. **Project Setup** - Established tooling and workflows
