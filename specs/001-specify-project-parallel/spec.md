**Feature Branch**: `001-specify-project-parallel`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Project: Parallel Trail Type: Retro-styled roguelike deck-builder web game"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a player, I want to experience a retro-styled roguelike deck-builder game where I control Penelope "Penny" Torres, a 23-year-old Mexican-American woman who wakes from a coma after a fatal car crash in Phoenix, Arizona. I want to explore branching timelines, engage in card-based combat, and uncover family secrets while navigating time loops and parallel universes. The game should be accessible to both retro game fans and casual players on desktop and mobile devices.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the title screen, **When** I start a new game, **Then** I should be introduced to Penny's backstory through the coma awakening scene
2. **Given** I am in the Hospital Hub, **When** I interact with NPCs, **Then** I should receive dialogue that hints at previous timeline loops
3. **Given** I enter an exploration area, **When** I encounter an event, **Then** I should be able to resolve it through card-based combat with clear enemy intentions
4. **Given** I am in a card battle, **When** I play cards from my deck, **Then** the effects should be immediately visible and impact the battle outcome
5. **Given** I reach a critical story moment, **When** a QTE triggers, **Then** I should have a limited time to respond with clear success/failure consequences
6. **Given** I die in a run, **When** the game resets, **Then** I should retain some meta-progression while starting a new timeline branch

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the player exhausts their deck during combat?
- How does the system handle multiple timeline branches that reference each other?
- What occurs if a player triggers paradox conditions through excessive time manipulation?
- How are bilingual dialogue options presented and resolved for non-Spanish speaking players?
- How should the game handle players with different accessibility needs (color blindness, text scaling)?
- What happens when players reach rest nodes between major encounters?
